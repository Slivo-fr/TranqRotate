# TranqRotate

This addon is meant to help hunters to setup tranqshot rotation and give them real time visual feedback about it.

It also allow non-hunter raid leaders to easily manage, report and watch the tranq rotation live. 

This addon will work even if you are the only one using it in your raid. (With some combat log range limitation, see bellow)

## Usage
 
Use `/tranq` for options

You must be in a raid for hunters to get registered and displayed by the addon.

First step is to setup your tranq rotation using drag & drop on hunters, if others hunters use the addon too, changes will be synced. 
You may use the trumpet button to report the rotation in raid chat so others players without the addon can know what you planned. 
Please note the backup group is hidden if empty but you can still drag hunters into it.

You can now just pull the boss and start shooting your tranqshots, TranqRotate will track the rotation and use a purple tranq-like color on the next hunter that should tranq. TranqRotate will play sounds when the previous hunter shot and you are the next, as well as when you have to use your tranqshot.

**Warning** : if all of your hunters does not use the addon, make sure someone with the addon stay within 45m range of hunters without the addon or you won't be able to register their tranqshot. MC and AQ40 tranq encounters might lead to range issues. However, I didn't had any complain about this yet  :) 

You can use the reset button in the top bar to reset the rotation status

You may adds the `/tranq backup` command to a macro that you can use when you are unable to tranq and you need some help,
It will whisper all backup hunters the fail message.

The `/tranq check` command allows you to list TranqRotate versions used by others players

## Roadmap

Here is a list of feature I want to implement at some point, no specific order is decided yet.

- Automatic reset of rotation when raid wipe
- Customization of the tranq window, size, textures, colors, fonts...
